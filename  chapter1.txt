Have you ever found something that felt like it was meant just for you? Thomlin hadn’t—until the morning he stumbled upon the map. It wasn’t supposed to be there, wedged beneath the loose floorboard of the old mill, pulsing with a faint silver glow. Go on—lean closer. See how the ink swirls like mist, how the edges curl as if whispering secrets only the brave dare follow? That trail marked in crimson? It leads straight into the Whispering Woods, a place no one dares speak of after dark. Thomlin should’ve left it. But you wouldn't have either, would you?

Elara carefully unfolded the map, its edges brittle with age. Symbols danced across the parchment—twisting paths, a crescent moon, and an emblem of a stag circled by stars. At the bottom, a delicate phrase caught her eye: “To those who seek, the forest speaks.” A chill prickled down her spine. Could it really be calling to her? She ran her fingers along a winding trail that disappeared into a grove marked with an ancient tree. The moment she touched it, a breeze stirred the leaves above her—though the air had been still just seconds before.

She glanced toward the edge of the woods, its shadows long and inviting. What if the stories were true? she wondered. Whispers of lost travelers, glowing eyes, and paths that moved on their own echoed in her mind—but so did her curiosity. With a breath full of courage, Elara tightened her satchel, tucked the map safely inside, and whispered to herself, “If the forest speaks, I’ll be the one to listen.” Then, heart pounding and eyes wide with wonder, she stepped beyond the village’s edge and into the waiting arms of the Whispering Woods.

Elara stepped cautiously into the Whispering Woods, the ancient trees arching overhead like silent sentinels, their leaves murmuring secrets in a tongue older than time. A cool mist clung to the forest floor, curling around her boots as shafts of pale light pierced the canopy in narrow beams. The air was thick with the scent of moss, damp earth, and something faintly sweet—like forgotten dreams. Her heart pounded, caught between fear and wonder, each footstep echoing louder in the hush. Though she was alone, the forest felt watchful, as if it had been expecting her.
