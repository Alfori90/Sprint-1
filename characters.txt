Elara, a spirited young villager with fire in her heart and wonder in her eyes, longs for more than quiet village life. One fateful day, she discovers a tattered, ancient map hidden beneath an old oak tree. Thrilled and fearless, she sets off toward the secrets it promises to unveil.
Shadow, Elara’s loyal wolf companion, is a creature of myth and moonlight. His obsidian fur shimmers in the dusk, and his amber eyes miss nothing. Born of the wild and bound by fate, he moves like a whisper through the woods—silent, fearless, and ever at Elara’s side when danger stirs.
